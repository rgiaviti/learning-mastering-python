# Numeric Literals
Numeric literals are used to represent numbers in a python program.In python we have different types of numeric literals such as integers, floating point numbers and complex numbers.

Integers in python are numbers with no fractional component. An integer representing a decimal number can be defined as follows.

## Literals
```python
myNum=1117      # integer
myNum=0b10101   # binary
myNum=0x123ab   # hexadecimal
myNum=0o124     # octal
myNum=123.345   # floating point
myNum=3+4j      # complex
```

```python
x = 5 + 6
y = 4.3 - 4
z = 5 + 5j
```
