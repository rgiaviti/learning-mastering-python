# Boolean Literals
There are only two Boolean literals in Python. They are `true` and `false`. In python, True represents the value as 1 and False represents the value as 0.

## Literals

```python
x = (1 == True)
y = (2 == False)
z = (3 == True)
r = (1 == True)
a = True + 10
b = False + 10
 
print("x is", x)
print("y is", y)
print("z is", r)
print("a:", a)
print("b:", b)
```
