# Collections Literals
There are four different types of literal collections

- List literals
- Tuple literals
- Dict literals
- Set literals

## List Literals

List contains items of different data types. The values stored in List are separated by comma (,) and enclosed within square brackets([]). We can store different types of data in a List. Lists are mutable.

```python
number = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
name = ['Amit', 'kabir', 'bhaskar', 2]
print(number)
print(name)
```

## Tuple Literals

A tuple is a collection of different data-type.  It is enclosed by the parentheses ‘()‘ and each element is separated by the comma(,). It is immutable.

```python
even_number = (2, 4, 6, 8)
odd_number = (1, 3, 5, 7)
 
print(even_number)
print(odd_number)
```

## Dict Literals

Dictionary stores the data in the key-value pair. It is enclosed by curly-braces ‘{}‘ and each pair is separated by the commas(,).  We can store different types of data in a dictionary. Dictionaries are mutable.

```python
alphabets = {'a': 'apple', 'b': 'ball', 'c': 'cat'}
information = {'name': 'amit', 'age': 20, 'ID': 20}
 
print(alphabets)
print(information)
```

## Set Literals

 Set is the collection of the unordered data set. It is enclosed by the {} and each element is separated by the comma(,).

```python
vowels = {'a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u'}
fruits = {"apple", "banana", "cherry"}
 
print(vowels)
print(fruits)
```
