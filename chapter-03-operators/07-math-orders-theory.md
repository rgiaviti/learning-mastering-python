# Math Orders Theory
Operator precedence determines the order in which operations are processed. In this tutorial, you will perform a mathemagical trick using nested parentheses to control Python operator precedence. If you’re just joining us, you may want to start with our previous post, Python Operators are Mathematical!

# Precedences
```
1	   ()  Parentheses
2	   **  Exponentiation
3	   *   Multiplication
4	   /   Division
5      +   Addition
6      –   Subtraction
```
