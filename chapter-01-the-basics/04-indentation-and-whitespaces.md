# Indentation and Whitespaces
Indentation in Python is simply the spaces at the beginning of a code line. Indentation in other languages like c, c++, etc., is just for readability, but in Python, the indentation is an essential and mandatory concept that should be followed when writing a python code; otherwise, the python interpreter throws IndentationError.

## Example
```python
# Indentation on functions
def my_function:
    a = 5
    b = 2
    return a + b

# Other example
for i in range(1, 10):
    print(i)
    if i == 6:
        break
```
