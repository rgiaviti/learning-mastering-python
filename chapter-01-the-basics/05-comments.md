# Comments in Python
Sometimes, you want to document the code that you write. For example, you may want to note why a piece of code works. To do it, you use the comments.

Typically, you use comments to explain formulas, algorithms, and complex business logic.

When executing a program, the Python interpreter ignores the comments and only interprets the code.

Python provides three kinds of comments including block comment, inline comment, and documentation string.

## Python block comments
```python
# increase price by 5%
price = price * 1.05
```

## Python inline comments
```python
salary = salary * 1.02   # increase salary by 2%
```

## Python docstrings

A documentation string is a string literal that you put as the first lines in a code block, for example, a function.

Unlike a regular comment, a documentation string can be accessed at run-time using `obj.__doc__` attribute where `obj` is the name of the function.

Typically, you use a documentation string to automatically generate the code documentation.

Documentation strings is called docstrings.

Technically speaking, docstrings are not the comments. They create anonymous variables that reference the strings. Also, theyâ€™re not ignored by the Python interpreter.

Python provides two kinds of docstrings: one-line docstrings and multi-line docstrings.

```python
def quicksort():
    """ sort the list using quicksort algorithm """
    ...
```

### Multi-line docstring
```python
def increase(salary, percentage, rating):
    """ increase salary base on rating and percentage
    rating 1 - 2 no increase
    rating 3 - 4 increase 5%
    rating 4 - 6 increase 10%
    """
```
