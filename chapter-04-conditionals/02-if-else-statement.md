# 'If-Else' Statement
The `else` keyword catches anything which isn't caught by the preceding conditions.

## Example
```python
a = 200
b = 33
if b > a:
  print("b is greater than a")
else:
  print("a is greater than b")
```

Short hand if-else
```python
a = 2
b = 330
print("A") if a > b else print("B")
```
