# 'If' Statement
Python supports the usual logical conditions from mathematics:

- Equals: `a == b`
- Not Equals: `a != b`
- Less than: `a < b`
- Less than or equal to: `a <= b`
- Greater than: `a > b`
- Greater than or equal to: `a >= b`
- These conditions can be used in several ways, most commonly in "if statements" and loops.

An "if statement" is written by using the `if` keyword.

## Example
```python
a = 33
b = 200
if b > a:
  print("b is greater than a")

if b > a and b > 100
  print("b is greater than a and b is greater than 100")
```

Short-hand if
```python
if a > b: print("a is greater than b")
```
